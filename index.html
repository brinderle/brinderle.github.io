    		<p id="BioText">I'm a student from Mechanicsville, Virginia, who is currently studying computer science at the University of Virginia.  I have completed two full years at UVA, but I only have one year left.  That's right!  I will be graduating one year early with the Class of 2019 in May.  While I will miss spending an extra year in Charlottesville, I am looking forward to the new opportunities that will come after graduation.</p>

    		<h2>My Interests</h2>
    		<p id="InterestsText">I'm a huge sports fan!  I grew up playing soccer and basketball and played both competitively from about age 5 until I finished high school.  In my free time, it is extremely likely that I'll be doing something involving sports, whether I'm going out to play a game with friends or watching my favorite teams.  I go to tons of games to cheer on the Hoos while I'm at school.  UVA basketball is my favorite team of any sport in the world, but I'll also root for LeBron James, wherever he is playing, along with Manchester United and the Redskins.  Aside from sports, I love playing video games on my PS4, mostly playing FIFA and Fortnite.</p>

    				</div>
    				<p>I'm very involved in my fraternity, where I have served as Secretary, Athletic Chair, and a member of the Philanthropy Committee.  It was nice developing skills in each of these positions, ranging from leadership to organization and planning.  Being a member of TKE has allowed me to grow as a person in many ways, making it a very beneficial experience for me.</p>

    				</div>
    				<p>HackCville is a club at UVA where students come to learn and develop certain skills that may not be available in normal classes.  In my first semester in HackCville, I took a program to learn web design, something I already found interesting and started to learn on my own.  In the Fall of 2018, I will be participating in another program focused on software development, specifically relating to web applications.</p>

    				<p>As I mentioned above, I love playing sports, so I have continued to stay involved during college.  Many of the intramural sports I play are with TKE, but I also form teams with some of my other friends.  This past year, I played on a total of nine different teams!</p>

    			<h1>University of Virginia, Class of 2019</h1>
    			<h5>Major: Computer Science, Minor: Economics, GPA: 3.86</h5>
    			<p>I started at UVA in the Fall of 2016 and will be graduating in May 2019.  In my time here, I have taken a variety of classes, but focused my efforts on computer science, economics, and mathematics.  I initially started taking computer science classes because I really liked problem-solving, while also appreciating the efficiency that computers bring to many processes in the world.  My interest in computer science has continued to grow as I have taken more classes at UVA.</p>
